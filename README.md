## Automation Task

We would like you to complete a small task to demonstrate your technical understanding of automation. Keep in mind scalability for the project. You are not expected to spend too much time on this, just between 45 mins to 1 hour, although it is not a timed task. Then create your own git repo and commit your changes there.
